Assumptions or Limitations
--------------------------
- The site is static; the contact form only validates input on the client side and does not send emails.
- All project and testimonial data is hardcoded in the HTML.
- No backend or database integration.
- Some links (such as resume download) and project links may require updating to actual resources.
- The site is designed for modern browsers with JavaScript enabled.
- Theming and navigation rely on JavaScript; disabling JS may affect usability.
